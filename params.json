{"name":"Irap","tagline":"integrated RNA-seq analysis pipeline","body":"# About iRAP\r\n\r\n iRAP is a flexible computational pipeline for RNA-seq that integrates many existing tools for filtering and mapping reads, quantifying expression and testing for differential expression. It is aimed at a broad group of users with basic  bioinformatics training and requires little experience with the command line but also provides more advanced users with the ability to customise the options used by their chosen tools.\r\n\r\n![Options on each stage of the pipeline](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~nf/irap_pipeline-www.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#  Quick links\r\n\r\n  * [Install Installation](https://github.com/nunofonseca/irap/wiki/How-to-install-and-update-iRAP)\r\n  * [Virtual Machines with iRAP](https://github.com/nunofonseca/irap/wiki/Virtual-Machines)\r\n  * [Usage](https://github.com/nunofonseca/irap/wiki/Run)\r\n  * [Output files](https://github.com/nunofonseca/irap/wiki/Output-files-and-directory-structure)\r\n\r\n# Suggestions and issues\r\n\r\n Errors may occur while running one of the many different pieces of software included in iRAP (e.g., a mapper, a quantification method, etc). If this happens then *please report the error directly to the developers of the software*.\r\n\r\n We always appreciate receiving suggestions for improvements, and  reports of bugs in the pipeline or in the documentation. \r\n\r\nPlease submit them through the [tracking system](https://github.com/nunofonseca/irap/issues) \r\n\r\nPlease post any questions about iRAP to the mailing list (irap_list@googlegroups.com) or to [SEQanswers](http://seqanswers.com/).\r\n","google":"UA-2286676-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
